To ensure good code quality and test coverage:

* `sage -t quiver.py` runs tests (currently there aren't many)
* `pycodestyle quiver.py` runs a PEP8 linter

There should be a way to run tests on the entire library, instead of on a
file-per-file basis.

Also, we should follow the guidelines on https://sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/developer/coding_basics.html as closely as possible!
