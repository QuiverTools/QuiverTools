# QuiverTools

A SageMath package to deal with quivers and moduli of quiver representations.

You can read its documentation as

* [a webpage](https://sage.quiver.tools)
* [a pdf](https://sage.quiver.tools/documentation.pdf)

A more detailed user guide is in the works.

# Instructions

You can install it by running

``sage --pip install git+https://github.com/QuiverTools/QuiverTools.git``

and then you can just do `from quiver import *` to get started.

# Other toolsets

Other algorithmic aspects of quivers, mostly disjoint of QuiverTools, can be found in

* https://folk.ntnu.no/oyvinso/QPA/, which focuses on calculations with actual representations
* https://smzg.github.io/msinvar/index.html, which focuses on DT-invariants
